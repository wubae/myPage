	<!--About Me Information-->
		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Growing up, I always had a difficult time finding a sport that was appealing and accessible to me.
			It wasn't until early in high school I became obsessed with progress and results in the gym. The
			aspect of training and results being enumerated has fascinated me. I eventually discovered powerlifting
			and created the first powerlifting club in our high school with a group of friends. I did my first powerlifting 
			meet in 2017 and fell in love with the sport. It wasn't until in college I started to offer coaching for free 
			to my fellow peers getting into the sport. I found coaching to be very rewarding and only wanted to further my craft. 
			I indulged myself with online resources, hands-on experience in powerlifting meets, and always trying to learn from others.

	<!--Testimonials for Coaching Service-->
		<h2>Testimonials</h2>

		<p>“As a fitness enthusiast, I have always strived to further enhance my athletic performance— especially when it 
			came to physical strength since it wasn’t my strongest suit. Through his proper and thorough instruction, 
			Wu really helped me achieve my goal. An item especially worth noting about Wu is his patience with ensuring that 
			his client fully understands the technicality behind every movement so that they are able to execute the 
			form/technique with success. Being the hard sport that it is, powerlifting can be discouraging at times.. 
			but Wu is always able to restore my confidence, and even praises any accomplishments I have made along the way— 
			no matter how big or small they are. It’s one thing to be a coach, but it’s another to also be an interpersonal, 
			strong supporter — something that Wu embodies.” - Amanda D.
		</p>

		<p>“Being at the gym for almost 2 years, I was never really consistent and was always just going to the gym just to “lift”. 
			I only made minor progress as it was called “Newbie” gains. I have been under Wu’s wing for almost one year now and I 
			can say he helped me be my strongest self with more improvements to come. He helped me get dialed down and always stay focused 
			when it came to my goal. When it came to technique, he was always consistent with honest feedback and had input on things that I 
			can always add to make my form better or how to adjust it to make it more optimal. Wu’s programming was consistent and always 
			adjusted it to fit my needs and targeted any weaknesses I had.” – Eljohn A.
